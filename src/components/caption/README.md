WD Tagger Caption - Simplified Demo

This is a demonstration of the new WD Tagger-only caption UI. The full implementation requires backend APIs that may not exist yet. This component demonstrates:

1. Model selector with install status
2. Tag editor with inline editing
3. Image browser with review mode
4. Settings panel
5. Auto-tag progress tracking

Note: This is a proof-of-concept. Full integration requires:
- WD models API (/api/wd/models)
- Tag editor APIs for loading/saving tags
- Updated main caption route

For now, this shows the UI structure and component integration.
